Document RESTful services by combining hand-written documentation with auto-generated
snippets produced with Spring MVC Test.

{% endcapture %}

{% capture main_content %}

Spring REST Docs helps you to document RESTful services. It combines hand-written
documentation written with [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/) and auto-generated
snippets produced with [Spring MVC Test](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle#spring-mvc-test-framework).
This approach frees you from the limitations of the documentation produced by tools like
[Swagger](http://swagger.io/). It helps you to produce documentation that is accurate,
concise, and well-structured. This documentation then allows your users to get the
information they need with a minimum of fuss.
